# A very basic NodeJS ü§ù TypeScript starter

A simple template to start a NodeJS and TypeScript project, based on my [Project: Basic Informational Site](https://github.com/thuyencode/nodejs-basic-informational-site-the-odin-project) for The Odin Project.

**Disclaimer:** This template doesn't include any tests (yet).

## Getting started

The [`./src`](./src/) folder contains the source code. The `./dist` folder contains the bundled source code and it'll be created when you run this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Use the following command to run and watch for any changes in the source code:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And use the following command to run the bundled code:

```bash
npm run start
```

For linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```
